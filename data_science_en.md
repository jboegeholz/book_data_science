## The difference between Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and AI
A picture says more than a thousand words.

Data Science tries to answer one of the following questions:

* Classification -> “Is it A or B?”
* Clustering -> “Are there groups which belong together?”
* Regression -> “How will it develop in the future?”
* Association -> “What is happening very often together?”
## Statistics
### Bayes Theorem

## Numpy

## Matplotlib

## Pandas


## Machine Learning

The Essence of Machine Learning

* A pattern exists
* The pattern cannot be described mathematically
* We have (enough) data on this problem


## The difference between supervised and unsupervised learning
Supervised Learning

You have training and test data with labels. 
Labels tell You to which e.g. class a certain data item belongs. 
Imagine you have images of pets and the labels are the name of the pets.

Unsupervised Learning

Your data doesn’t have labels. Your algorithm e.g. k-means clustering need to figure out a structure given only the data
